* Things that Need To Be Done

** Configuration

*** TODO Frontend for configuring responders

A responder may need to be configured to deal with multiple commands
or built-in configurations. For example /deploy-eparts-dev would need
to be configured to trigger the Jenkins responder with a particular
configuration. It would be nice (if possible with the Slack API) to
automatically register commands with Slack as well.

*** TODO jsonconfig extension to read from Azure table storage

Will help with the above...

*** TODO Chef cookbook for installing and configuring

** Jenkins responder

*** TODO Use the configuration extensions above to register

*** TODO find another package or just use HTTP

So we can pass the context in when we make the request so resources
will be properly tidied away on timeout.

*** TODO tests

** Slackbot binary

*** TODO Will need to be able to trigger a reconfiguration

** Throughout

*** TODO Proper logging

** Responders

*** Rally

**** TODO add new candidate story

Params:
